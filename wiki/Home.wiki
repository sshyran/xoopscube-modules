=UNMG Distribution=

Ultimate Newbies Modules Guide Distribution is mainly based on [http://xoopscube.org/modules/xhnewbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=600&viewmode=flat forum thread] started by [http://xoopscube.org/userinfo.php?uid=158 Angelos]

This UNMG Distribution will run Package Legacy and D3 modules out of the box 

thanks to the wamp server compilation made by Mikhail.

UNMG Distribution is not a fork of XOOPS Cube, 

it is only a package to set everybody free

to experiment and enjoy XOOPS Cube Legacy.


==Philosophical==

{{{
"Learn everything you can.
Try everything that comes along.
Look at everything there is to see.
Search, experiment, make mistakes, fail, stand up.
Turn religious, turn conservative, turn radical.
And then forget all about it and find your way to create."
