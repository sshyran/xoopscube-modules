A complete and painless install of Apache, PHP, mySql, phpMyAdmin and XOOPS Cube with everything pre-configured and ready to roll. With a single click an unintrusive local test server is up and running, allowing you a hassle free way to get going with Mambo Open Source in an amazingly short period of time. No more messing with config files or services under any Windows environment and if you have these products installed, XOOPServer will not overwrite or change any currently installed product.

XOOPServer comes with  a user friendly control panel that lets you control every aspect of the environment though an easy to use web interface.  No more messing with complex config files. Just point and click.

To uninstall, simply delete the entire directory since their is nothing to install!
