1. Mobile phone

I tested in Japanese DoCoMo imodo simulator and the actual phone N903i.
By the case of N903i.
The phone can show the photo which the same phone posted.
But the phone show broken photo which bigger than.
The phone can show the video (i motion)  which the same phone posted.
But the phone cannot show other format video.
I am happy when you teach me the other model's information .

1.2 Path to temporary
this module preserves the received emails in this derectory.
It is not desirably that preserve emails in the accessible area by the WEB browsers such as the document route, because the email has personal information.
Recommend to set to this out of the document route.

2. Post by FTP
Because http protocol has a time limit and file size limit, 
the user cannot upload the large file.
This limitation is eased to use FTP.
On the other hand, with the FTP, the user can access XOOPS files.
Please operate in the pal who can trust.
Or, if the admin can add two or more FTP users,
operate by the setting which the user cannot access XOOPS files.


* Notice *
Although there are no big problem, but I think that there are any small problem.

set "Yes" in "Check templates for modifications ?"

(5) after confirm to work popup photo in block,
set "No" in "Check templates for modifications ?"
