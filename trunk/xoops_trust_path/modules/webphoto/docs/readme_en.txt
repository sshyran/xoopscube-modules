* Notice for usage *
1. ffmpeg
"ffmpeg" is operated depends on the version and the compilation option.
Sometimes you have to set options, when create Flash video.
You can set "ffmpeg" command option for creating Flash video in mime table.
In default, set "-ar 44100" in all video types.

2. Avoid for conflict to use "xoops_module_header"
Sometime dont work popup photo in block.
Is is one of the cause that other module or other block conflict to use the template variable xoops_module_header.
webphoto prepared two ways of avoiding this.

2.1 The way to prepare the special template variable
(1) please add the special template variable to the theme template file

XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/themes/YOUR_THEME/theme.html
-----
<{$xoops_module_header}>
<{* add the following *}>
<{$xoops_webphoto_header}>
-----

(2) rename preload file
XOOPS_TRUUST_PATH/modules/webphoto/preload/_constants.php (with undebar)
 -> constants.php (without undebar)

(3) change _C_WEBPHOTO_PRELOAD_XOOPS_MODULE_HEADER in valid
remove // at the head.
-----
//define("_C_WEBPHOTO_PRELOAD_XOOPS_MODULE_HEADER", "xoops_webphoto_header" )
-----

(4) admin CP -> Preferences Main -> General Settings
set "Yes" in "Check templates for modifications ?"

(5) after confirm to work popup photo in block,
set "No" in "Check templates for modifications ?"


2.2 The way to describe style_sheet and javascript in boby part in the block
it is the HTML validation error that describe style_sheet in boby part.
however, it seems that the WEB browser operate well

(1) rename preload file
XOOPS_TRUUST_PATH/modules/webphoto/preload/_constants.php (with undebar)
 -> constants.php (without undebar)

(2) change _C_WEBPHOTO_PRELOAD_BLOCK_POPBOX_JS in valid
remove // at the head.
-----
//define("_C_WEBPHOTO_PRELOAD_BLOCK_POPBOX_JS", "1" )
-----


* Notice *
Although there are no big problem, but I think that there are any small problem. 
Even if some problems come out, only those who can do somehow personally need to use. 
Welcome a bug report, a bug solution, and your hack, etc.
