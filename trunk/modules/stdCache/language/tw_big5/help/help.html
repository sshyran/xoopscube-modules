<h4>基本緩衝暫存模組</h4>
<h5>摘要</h5>
<p>這個模組在基本的 Legacy 系統中加入暫存緩衝的政策。 這個政策安排 Legacy 系統為除了系統管理員群組外的所有群組建立暫存檔。</p>

<h5>這是甚麼?</h5>
<p>Legacy System module has contents cache feature for modules and blocks. The cache feature saves the content of their work to files, if cache setting is active. And, if cache files are available, Legacy System prevents the logic and SQL of blocks and modules. That's very powerful but very dangerous, because there is not the cache policy.</p>

<p>For example, if Legacy System makes the cache file for administrators' access, anonymous users may see the cache file having secret informations which only administrators can access. For security, Legacy System should make the cache file for every groups. But, this way makes too many files in your server. In other words, Legacy System doesn't know what you hope.</p>

<p>This module is one of cache modules and adds the standard cache policy to Legacy System. The policy orders Legacy System to make the cache file for every groups except the administrator group.</p>

<p>所以, the cache policy of this module makes many files, so you should install "cache clear block". This block is imvisible and deletes all of cache files including extra cache files, with interval timer. </p>
